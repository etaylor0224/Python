'''write me a python script that scrapes this website "https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/" every 10 seconds it needs to check the products list for available upgrades and purchase them and it needs to run for 5 minutes using selenium for web scraping'''

# Set up the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/")

# Define the duration for scraping (5 minutes = 300 seconds)
end_time = time.time() + 300

while time.time() < end_time:
    # Check for available upgrades
    try:
